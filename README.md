Task Overview:

Build a News App using React Native that fetches news articles from a public API (e.g., NewsAPI) and displays them in a pixel-perfect UI based on the provided Figma design.

Requirements:

Pixel-Perfect UI Implementation:
Implement the UI design provided in the Figma link using React Native components.
Pay attention to details such as spacing, typography, colors, and overall layout to achieve pixel-perfect fidelity to the design.

Data Fetching:

Utilize Axios (or any preferred HTTP client) to fetch news articles from a public API (e.g. NewsAPI).
Display the fetched news articles in the app based on the design requirements.

Navigation:

Implement navigation between different screens as per the design (e.g., Home screen, Article detail screen).
Ensure smooth transitions and user experience.

Steps:

Set Up the Project:

Initialize a new React Native project.
Set up necessary dependencies (e.g., Axios for HTTP requests, React Navigation for navigation).

Implement UI Components:
Create the necessary React Native components to match the UI design.
Use appropriate layout components (e.g., View, Text, Image, ScrollView) to structure the app screens.

Fetch Data:
Integrate Axios to make API requests to fetch news articles.
Handle API responses and update the app state accordingly.

Display News Articles:

Render the fetched news articles in the designated sections of the UI.
Ensure that each article item links to a detailed view (article detail screen) when clicked.

Navigation:
Implement navigation between screens using React Navigation.
Set up appropriate navigation stacks and routes.

Testing and Finalization:

Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly.
Verify that the UI matches the provided design.
Make any necessary adjustments to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy.

Resources:
Figma Design: News App Figma Design
Public API: Consider using NewsAPI or any other suitable news API for fetching news articles.

Evaluation Criteria:
Adherence to the provided design (pixel-perfect implementation).
Proper use of React Native components and state management.
Effective integration of data fetching using Axios.
Correct navigation implementation.
Code readability, organization, and best practices.
